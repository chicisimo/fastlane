# Features
- Connect all tools, part of the ```fastlane``` toolchain to work seamlessly together
- Define different ```deployment lanes``` for App Store deployment, beta builds or testing
- Deploy from any computer
- [Jenkins Integration](#jenkins-integration): Show the output directly in the Jenkins test results
- Write your [own actions](#extensions) (extensions) to extend the functionality of `fastlane`
- Store data like the ```Bundle Identifier``` or your ```Apple ID``` once and use it across all tools
- Never remember any difficult commands, just ```fastlane```
- Easy setup, which helps you getting up and running very fast
- Shared context, which is used to let the different deployment steps communicate with each other
- Store **everything** in git. Never lookup the used build commands in the ```Jenkins``` configs
- Saves you **hours** of preparing app submission, uploading screenshots and deploying the app for each update
- Very flexible configuration using a fully customizable `Fastfile`
- Once up and running, you have a fully working **Continuous Deployment** process. Just trigger ```fastlane``` and you're good to go.

##### Take a look at the [fastlane website](http://fastlane.tools) for more information about why and when to use `fastlane`.

# Installation

I recommend following the [fastlane guide](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane/blob/master/GUIDE.md) to get started.

If you are familiar with the command line and Ruby, install `fastlane` yourself:

    sudo gem install fastlane

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install


If you want to take a look at a project, already using `fastlane`, check out the [fastlane-example project](https://github.com/krausefx/fastlane-example) on GitHub.

# Quick Start


The setup assistent will create all the necessary files for you, using the existing app metadata from iTunes Connect.

- ```cd [your_project_folder]```
- ```fastlane init```
- Follow the setup assistent, which will set up ```fastlane``` for you
- Further customise the ```Fastfile``` using the next section

For a more detailed setup, please follow the [fastlane guide](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane/blob/master/GUIDE.md).

# Customise the ```Fastfile```
Why should you have to remember complicated commands and parameters?

Store your configuration in a text file to easily deploy from any computer.

Open the ```Fastfile``` using a text editor and customise it even further. (Switch to *Ruby* Syntax Highlighting)

### Lanes
You can define multiple ```lanes``` which are different workflows for a release process.

Examples are: ```appstore```, ```beta``` and ```test```.

You define a ```lane``` like this (more details about the commands in the [Actions](#actions) section):
```ruby
lane :appstore do
  increment_build_number
  cocoapods
  xctool
  snapshot
  sigh
  deliver
  frameit
  sh "./customScript.sh"

  slack
end
```

To launch the ```appstore``` lane run
```
fastlane appstore
```

When one command fails, the execution will be aborted.


### Actions
There are some predefined actions you can use. If you have ideas for more, please let me know.

#### [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)
Everyone using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) will probably want to run a ```pod install``` before running tests and building the app. 
```ruby
cocoapods # this will run pod install
```


#### [xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool)
You can run any xctool action. This will require having [xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool) installed through [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
```ruby
xctool :test
```

It is recommended to have the `xctool` configuration stored in a [`xctool-args`](https://github.com/facebook/xctool#configuration-xctool-args) file.

#### [snapshot](https://github.com/KrauseFx/snapshot)
```ruby
snapshot
```

To make `snapshot` work without user interaction, follow the [CI-Guide of `snapshot`](https://github.com/KrauseFx/snapshot#run-in-continuous-integration).

#### [sigh](https://github.com/KrauseFx/sigh)
This will generate and download your App Store provisioning profile. ```sigh``` will store the generated profile in the ```./fastlane``` folder.
```ruby
sigh
```

To use the Ad Hoc profile instead
```ruby
sigh :adhoc
```

#### [deliver](https://github.com/KrauseFx/deliver)
```ruby
deliver
```

If you don't want a PDF report, which you have to approve first, append ```:force``` to the command. This is useful when running ```fastlane``` on your Continuous Integration server.
```ruby
deliver :force
```

- ```deliver :beta```: Upload a beta build for Apple TestFlight
- ```deliver :skip_deploy```: To don't submit the app for review (works with both App Store and beta builds)
- ```deliver :force, :skip_deploy```: Combine options using ```,```

#### [frameit](https://github.com/KrauseFx/frameit)
By default, the device color will be black
```ruby
frameit
```

To use white (sorry, silver) device frames
```ruby
frameit :silver
```

#### [increment_build_number](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1827/_index.html)
This method will increment the **build number**, not the app version. Usually this is just an auto incremented number. You first have to [set up your Xcode project](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1827/_index.html), if you haven't done it already.

```ruby
increment_build_number # automatically increment by one
increment_build_number '75' # set a specific number
```

#### [HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net)
```ruby
hockey({
  api_token: '...',
  ipa: './app.ipa',
  notes: "Changelog"
})
```

Symbols will also be uploaded automatically if a `app.dSYM.zip` file is found next to `app.ipa`. In case it is located in a different place you can specify the path explicitly in `:dsym` parameter.

More information about the available options can be found in the [HockeyApp Docs](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/api/api-versions#upload-version).

#### [Crashlytics](https://try.crashlytics.com)
```ruby
crashlytics({
  crashlytics_path: './path',
  api_token: '...',
  build_secret: '...',
  ipa_path: './app.ipa'
})
```

#### [Slack](http://slack.com)
Send a message to **#channel** (by default) or a direct message to **@username** with success (green) or failure (red) status.

```ruby
  slack({
    message: "App successfully released!",
    channel: "#channel",
    success: true,
  })
```

#### [Testmunk](http://testmunk.com)
Run your functional tests on real iOS devices over the cloud (for free on an iPod). With this simple [testcase](https://github.com/testmunk/TMSample/blob/master/testcases/smoke/smoke_features.zip) you can ensure your app launches and there is no crash at launch. Tests can be extended with [Testmunk's library](http://docs.testmunk.com/en/latest/steps.html) or custom steps. More details about this action can be found in [`testmunk.rb`](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane/blob/master/lib/fastlane/actions/testmunk.rb).
```ruby
ENV['TESTMUNK_EMAIL'] = 'email@email.com'
# Additionally, you have to set TESTMUNK_API, TESTMUNK_APP and TESTMUNK_IPA
testmunk
```

#### Custom Shell Scripts
```ruby
sh "./your_bash_script.sh"
```

### *before_all* block
This block will get executed *before* running the requested lane. It supports the same actions as lanes.

```ruby
before_all do
  cocoapods
end
```

### *after_all* block
This block will get executed *after* running the requested lane. It supports the same actions as lanes.

It will only be called, if the selected lane was executed **successfully**.

```ruby
after_all do |lane|
  say "Successfully finished deployment (#{lane})!"
  slack({
    message: "Successfully submitted new App Update"
  })
  sh "./send_screenshots_to_team.sh" # Example
end
```

### *error* block
This block will get executed when an error occurs, in any of the blocks (*before_all*, the lane itself or *after_all*). 
```ruby
error do |lane, exception|
  slack({
    message: "Successfully deployed new App Update for [AppName](http://link.com).",
    success: false
  })
end
```

# Extensions
Why only use the default actions? Create your own to extend the functionality of `fastlane`.

The build step you create will behave exactly like the built in actions.

Just run `fastlane new_action`. Then enter the name of the action and edit the generated Ruby file in `fastlane/actions/[action_name].rb`.

From then on, you can just start using your action in your `Fastfile`.

If you think your extension can be used by other developers as well, let me know, and we can bundle it with `fastlane`.

# Jenkins Integration

`fastlane` automatically generates a JUnit report for you. This allows Continuous Integration systems, like `Jenkins`, access the results of your deployment. 

## Installation
The recommended way to install [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) is through [homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```brew update && brew install jenkins```

From now on start ```Jenkins``` by running:
```
jenkins
```

To store the password in the Keychain of your remote machine, I recommend running `sigh` or `deliver` using ssh or remote desktop at least once.

If you're using `Jenkins` as its own user, you might run into problems with `homebrew` and `phantomjs`.

## Deploy Strategy

You should **not** deploy a new App Store update after every commit, since you still have to wait 1-2 weeks for the review. Instead I recommend using Git Tags, or custom triggers to deploy a new update. 

You can set up your own ```Release``` job, which is only triggered manually.

## Plugins

I recommend the following plugins:

- **[HTML Publisher Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/HTML+Publisher+Plugin):** Can be used to show the generated screenshots right inside Jenkins.
- **[AnsiColor Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/AnsiColor+Plugin):** Used to show the coloured output of the fastlane tools. Dont' forget to enable `Color ANSI Console Output` in the `Build Environment` or your project.
- **[Rebuild Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Rebuild+Plugin):** This plugin will save you a lot of time.

## Build Step
Use the following as your build step:
```
fastlane appstore
```
Replace `appstore` with the lane you want to use.

## Test Results and Screenshtos

To show the **deployment result** right in `Jenkins`

- *Add post-build action*
- *Publish JUnit test result report*
- *Test report XMLs*: `fastlane/report.xml`

To show the **generated screenhots** right in `Jenkins`

- *Add post-build action*
- *Publish HTML reports*
- *HTML directory to archive*: `fastlane/screenshots`
- *Index page*: `screenshots.html`

Save and run. The result should look like this:

# Tips

## [`fastlane`](http://fastlane.tools) Toolchain

- [`deliver`](https://github.com/KrauseFx/deliver): Upload screenshots, metadata and your app to the App Store using a single command
- [`snapshot`](https://github.com/KrauseFx/snapshot): Automate taking localized screenshots of your iOS app on every device
- [`frameit`](https://github.com/KrauseFx/frameit): Quickly put your screenshots into the right device frames
- [`PEM`](https://github.com/KrauseFx/pem): Automatically generate and renew your push notification profiles
- [`sigh`](https://github.com/KrauseFx/sigh): Because you would rather spend your time building stuff than fighting provisioning

## Advanced
#### Lane Context
The different actions can *communicate* with each other using a shared hash. 
Access them in your scrips using:
```ruby
Actions.lane_context[Actions::SharedValues::LANE_NAME] # the name of the current lane
```
Available variables (put that inside the square brackets of the above snippet)
```ruby
Actions::SharedValues::BUILD_NUMBER # generated by `increment_build_number`
Actions::SharedValues::SNAPSHOT_SCREENSHOTS_PATH # generated by `snapshot`
Actions::SharedValues::DELIVER_IPA_PATH
Actions::SharedValues::SIGH_PROFILE_PATH # generated by `sigh`
Actions::SharedValues::HOCKEY_DOWNLOAD_LINK #generated by `hockey`
````

#### Complex Fastfile Example
```ruby
before_all do
  ENV["SLACK_URL"] = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."

  increment_build_number
  cocoapods
  xctool :test
end

lane :beta do
  sigh :adhoc
  deliver :beta
  hockey({
    api_token: '...',
    ipa: './app.ipa'
  })
end

lane :deploy do
  sigh
  snapshot
  deliver :force
  frameit
end

after_all do |lane|
  slack({
    message: "Successfully deployed a new version."
  })
  say "My job is done here"
end

error do |lane, exception|
  slack({
    message: "An error occured"
  })
end
```

#### Snapshot
To skip cleaning the project on every build
```ruby
snapshot :noclean
```

#### Run multiple ```lanes```
You can run multiple ```lanes``` (in the given order) using
```
fastlane test inhouse appstore
````
Keep in mind the ```before_all``` and ```after_all``` block will be executed for each of the ```lanes```.

#### Hide the `fastlane` folder
Just rename the folder to `.fastlane` in case you don't want it to be visible in the Finder. 

#### Load own actions from external folder
Add this to the top of your `Fastfile` (*.* is the `fastlane` folder)
```ruby
actions_path '../custom_actions_folder/'
```
